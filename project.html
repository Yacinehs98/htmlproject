               <h3><u>Old Architecture:</u></h3>
                <p>One of the lasting contributions ancient cultures have made to modern life is architecture, both in terms of surviving monuments and their influence on contemporary buildings around the world. Ambitious rulers set up pyramids in Egypt and the Americas, while arches of one form or another dotted many Roman cities and Japanese sacred sites. Walls were another popular and often necessary feature of ancient landscapes, amongst the most famous being Hadrian's Wall in Britain, the Great Wall of China and the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople but there were many more besides. Theatres, amphitheatres and stadiums were all common features of ancient cities from North Africa to Western Turkey and are still being imitated today from Rio to Qatar.
                    The Classical architectural orders, adapted from Near Eastern and Egyptian prototypes, were first seen in Greece and then expanded by the Etruscans and the Romans, gaining such wide acceptance as a symbol of grand building schemes that few cities around the world today do not have a courthouse, opera house or public library with a facade bristling with classical columns. This collection examines all the above and more, including Hindu architecture and its complex mathematics and rules which are followed across the temple sites of the sub-Indian continent, the master masons of the Incas, and the still-influential churches of the Byzantines.

                <h3><u>Modern Architecture:</u></h3>
                <p>Architecture is a broad term where the process extends from sketching simple lines on a piece of paper to creating magnificent monuments that stand tall for ages. At its roots, architecture exists to create a physical environment in which people live, but architecture is more than just a built environment, it’s also a part of our culture and background. 

                    Modern or Futuristic Architecture style is using new and contemporary technologies of building construction, particularly the use of glass, metal, and reinforced concrete. Modernism in architecture also alludes to an embrace of minimalism and the dismissal of unnecessary ornamentation, which has been a popular style of construction through various civilizations and ages. It’s the understanding that future generations need sustainable, self-sufficient, minimal structures that have less carbon footprint and fulfil the requirements of an ideal built space.
                    In Architecture, while the concept of shelter is a fairly simple thing, the style of buildings was originally shaped by the climate of a particular location, what materials were readily available, as well as the cultural values of the society building them. With progressing times, the world became more and more connected, the styles evolved, but even in modern construction, there is still an importance in honouring the cultural nuances in the built environment. 
                    
                    The type of structures that we construct has to take into account multiple factors such as disaster management, efficient space utilization, the need for sustainability, and the worsening climatic conditions. The basis for the sustainable development of human settlements is the effective planning of urban settlements based on the concept of compact development as opposed to extensive territorial growth. The never-ending saga of human settlements and the exponentially increasing population makes architecture lose its essence of function and mostly aims at providing bare minimum shelters. The methods undoubtedly provide a living space but lack in many key aspects such as proper zoning and distribution of circulation space and getting the right amount of sunlight. Thus, the built spaces are not as aesthetically pleasing and don’t have harmony among spaces as well as in the neighbourhood. </p>

                <h3><u>buildings architecture:</u></h3>
                <p>When it comes to learning about the history of a new destination, travelers should look no further than its iconic buildings. Of course, there are other ways to discover the local culture, which can be reflected in the food, the textiles, and the dialects, but it’s the buildings that can reveal the most about a place. Local landmarks are—in essence— silent witnesses to past eras, kingdoms, and tastes, but they can also offer us clues to what the future holds (not to mention make for a great travel gram, too).

                    Consider this lineup to be a travel bucket list of sorts. These buildings are renowned for various reasons—some for their architectural charm, others for their historical significance, and some for a healthy mix of both. A fair amount of them are well-known, of course: Think Europe’s museums, churches, and other landmarks whose replicas live on in souvenir shops and countless photos. There are also, of course, a decent number on this list designed by famous architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and Oscar Niemeyer too. And while some of these edifices exist off the beaten path, they’re just as important in their own right. Here, AD rounds up iconic buildings from around the world that you’ll be glad you’ve seen when you look back on your travels. It’s been said that travel is the only thing you can buy that makes you richer, and we couldn’t agree more.</p>
